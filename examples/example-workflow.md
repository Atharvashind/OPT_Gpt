## 📘 Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Project

1. Open a new ChatGPT conversation
2. Paste the **Mini Init Prompt**
3. Start working normally

You do **not** need to think about OPT_Gpt again unless the chat becomes long or complex.

---

### Example 2: Long Chat → Continuity File

When GPT suggests a continuity checkpoint and you approve, it will generate a **continuity file**.

You should:
- copy it
- save it locally (notes, repo, doc)
- paste it into the *next chat* for the same project

---

### Example 3: Resuming Work in a New Chat

1. Open a new chat
2. Paste **only the continuity file**
3. Continue working immediately

No need to paste rules or init prompt again.
